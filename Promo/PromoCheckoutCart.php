 * @todo      The pro-rating of promotion and quantity discounts hasn't been
 *            tested with sale discounts, and probably is broken if we start
 *            using them. As well, there is an edge case that we don't handle.
 *            For example, item 1 is $1, item 2 is $1000, total discount is $3.
 *            In that case, depending on rounding, totalling the item discounts
 *            could be off by a small margin. Probably not worth fixing.
